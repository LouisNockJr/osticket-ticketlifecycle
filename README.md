</p>
<p>

  ## Step 1: Create a New Ticket (End-User)

As an end-user, create a new support ticket describing the issue:
  - **Help Topic:** Report a Problem / Business Critical Outage
  - **Subject:** Online/Mobile Banking System is Down  
  - **Description:** I cannot access online or mobile banking services. The system appears to be completely offline.

</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>

  ## Step 2: View Ticket Details (Help Desk Agent: `john`)

Log in as the Help Desk Agent `john`.  
Locate the new ticket and review the following fields:

- **Priority**
- **Department**
- **SLA (Service Level Agreement)**
- **Assigned To**

</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>

  ## Step 3: Update Ticket Properties

Set the appropriate ticket properties based on the severity of the issue:

- **Priority:** Sev-A (1 hour, 24/7 response)
  - **Optional Reason for Update:** Wide impact, customer unable to do online banking 
- Add Context (**Optional Reason for Update**) to **Help Topic:** No customers able to do online banking
- **Department:** Online Banking Department
  - **Optional Reason for Update:** Customers not able to access online banking portal, assigning to Online Banking team.

</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>

  ## Step 4: Re-Verify Access as `john`

After updating, attempt to review the ticket again while still logged in as `john`.  

Can `john` still **view** or **edit** the ticket after changes were applied?

  ## Step 5: Resolve Ticket as `jane`

Now log in as the agent `jane`.  

Take ownership of the ticket:
  - Change **Assigned To** from `Online Banking` to `Jane Doe`
  - **Optional reason for the assignment:** I'll be taking this ticket

Perform the required troubleshooting or communication steps, and **work the ticket to completion**.

- Update the ticket with resolution details:
  - **It was determined the root cause was the recent update. We rolled it back, notified the vendor, and are waiting for a proper fix. Online banking should now be up and running.**
- Mark the ticket as **Resolved**

<h2> üèÅ Creating and Managing Support Tickets </h2>

As a Help Desk agent, you‚Äôll receive support requests through many different channels ‚Äî phone calls, chat messages, emails, web forms, or even in-person conversations (like someone catching you in the hallway or stopping by your desk).

While it‚Äôs perfectly okay to help someone right away when you can, **it‚Äôs important to always create a ticket for every issue you handle** ‚Äî no matter how small it may seem.

## Why?

- **Tracking:** Tickets allow us to keep a record of what work is being done.  
- **Metrics:** They help us measure volume, response times, and workload.  
- **Accountability:** They ensure we‚Äôre not missing recurring issues or trends.

Even if you solve a problem on the spot, take a moment afterward to document it by creating a ticket. It‚Äôs a key part of providing consistent, reliable support.
